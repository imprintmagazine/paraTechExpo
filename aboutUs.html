          <h3>Anil Chopra</h3>
          <p>Anil Chopra founder of India’s first professional pro audio magazine in 1986 that effectually developed
            music business in India teachin record labels professional A&R and music company management. Playback And
            Fast Forward editorial focused on Music Recording Studio technology and expertise guided by India’s most
            famous Recording engineer Daman Sood, who himself set new paradigm of recording arts and expertise at
            Western Outdoor Studios. Music business too expanded to hundreds of new born record labels with the advent
            of Compact Cassette. Playback and Fast Forward became the source for all technology for music recording and
            production of Compact cassettes technology of high-speed duplication. </p>
          <p>Copyright and piracy forced the magazine to focus only on technology, which was a blessing in disguise. In
            1992 Video recording and video publishing and broadcast revolution set in and Studio Systems which ushered
            in the compact cassette manufacturing revolution in transferring latest production information and contacts
            of sourcing cassettes components for mass production, once again was the primary source in ushering in the
            compact disc revolution in the country.</p>
          <p>Thus in 1999 Studio Systems organised the first Optical Disc Technical Seminar series in the Taj Mahal
            Palace Hotel in Apollo Bundar, which led to the launch of first and only expo on optical media (CD/DVD) in
            2001- 2008 Replication Asia in New Delhi at the TajMahal Palace convention centre, Dhaula Kuan.later
            retitled as Disc Tech Expo. </p>
          <p>This was followed by the pro audio industry represented by sound engineers led by Daman Sood to establish a
            dedicated Pro Audio expo since at that point India had just the Broadcast India expo which did not satisfy
            the pro sound industry. Since Infocast Systems was the only publisher in India since 1986 publishing a pro
            audio magazine the professional fraternity felt it our responsibility to organise India’s first Pro Audio
            Expo.</p>
          <p>The founder Anil Chopra created the acronym PALM – Pro Audio Live [sound] Music [production]. The first
            PALM was held at Nehru Centre in Mumbai along with Cinema India. The mix was electric and succeeded in
            establishing the expos for a nascent industry. Returning from a trip attending the Replitech expo at the
            Hong Kong Convention Centre the founder Anil Chopra visited the Cinema theatre expo organised concurrently
            at another level. On returning to India the sense of dynamism and sense of purpose in pushing new technology
            in audio and video Cinema India was born as a twin of PALM Expo.</p>
          <p>Soon the stable of magazines included the gamut of technologies in audio and video recording and media.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Studio Systems for video and broadcast</li>
            <li>Pro Sound Systems for pro audio and live sound</li>
            <li>Cinema Systems for cinema projection and multiplex technology</li>
            <li>Optical Disc Systems for CD, DVD, optical storage</li>
          </ul>
          <p>“Information Casting was the mantra for development of Indian media industries in adopting high-tech and
            investing in establishing a robust economy in production of audio video content and media” stated Anil
            Chopra, Editor of all Infocast magazines and founder of trade expos, awards, seminars, summits, conference.
          </p>
          <p>Infocast and its various media have played the role of catalyst in ushering in the revolutions in music
            business, music media such as compact cassette, compact disc, digital cinema, multiplex revolution, pro
            sound and lighting industry for stage and install, recording studios and video production. All this from
            1986-2009.</p>

            global industry and ODS magazine discovered the inventor kept hidden by Nichia and Japanese manufactures of
            blue ray discs and players who were opposed to Shubhi Nakamura receiving any recognition or award. Anil
            Chopra a leader of replication industry including being a founder of Media Tech expo Frankfurt took the
